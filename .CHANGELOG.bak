v1.2	190724
  -	Added a few new functions in colormap
  -	Got rid of all the other scripts
  -	"__cmap" now shows all the colors, 1, 2, 3
	  -	If the grey shade table is too wide for the
		terminals screen, it will show the verticle
		table instead.
  - "__cmap" and the colormap script is still pretty
	messy.
		- [TODO1] Still need to clean up the file
  - "__cmap" only shows colors with the assumption
	that the terminal is white on black.
		- [TODO2] Want to make two versions, another one that
		  displays on a white background so you can see
		  how it affects the colors.
